**4. PAGESPEED BOOST**
The common reason that lies behind website slowness is large and not-optimized images. There might be product photos, infographics, illustrated instructions, how-to images, and others. That is why the Pagespeed Boost tool is a great solution for those looking to optimize their images in a quick and effective way.


* **Image CDN**
In the era of smartphones and mobile Internet, it’s important to make sure that your website images load in a flash. This is crucial for e-commerce websites because customers always want to view products from all angles. The Semalt SEO plugin uses a CDN to ensure the lightning-fast website image loading. A CDN (content delivery network) is our network of servers located around the globe that can help deliver content to your site users almost instantly.


**How it works:**
We determine the location of the user so that images are delivered from a geographically closer server. Besides, when the user requests an image on his or her device (by simply opening one of your website’s pages), we cache this image. So, when another user requests the same image on a similar device, we can deliver the pre-cached image almost immediately.


 * **Image optimization**
The Pagespeed Boost tool can find and analyze all the images on your website without you lifting a finger. Enable image optimization to make sure all the images that you upload to your site are automatically optimized to meet Google search engine requirements. You don’t have to use third-party image compression tools. Pagespeed Boost can do this in background mode as you upload images to your WordPress admin panel.


* **Resized images**
WordPress generates resized versions of each image, which is why the Pagespeed Boost tool has a lot of work to do. Enable optimization for resized image versions to make sure your website’s loading speed is not compromised. This is especially important if you can’t find all the resized images created by WordPress. After installing the Semalt SEO plugin, you will never worry about this again as the Pagespeed Boost tool will do everything for you.
